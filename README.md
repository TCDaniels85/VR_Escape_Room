# VR_Escape_Room
 Virtual reality escape room developed for the Quest 2

The aim of this project was to create an interactive virtual environment that can be used 
with a virtual reality (VR) headset. The application presented is an escape room simulator. 
The player is tasked to explore a virtual environment, search for clues, and perform tasks to 
eventually escape from the level. The simulator involves and number of puzzles and 
minigames that the player must complete to obtain trophies in order to open the final door 
and complete the game.


This application was developed in Unity for the Meta Quest 2 headset. Performance is an important aspect of VR development; a low frame rate (FPS) can result in an uncomfortable experience for the user a may induce motion sickness. Latency caused by poor performance is a major factor in an uncomfortable VR experience, therefore performance and comfort were considerations throughout the development process. Techniques such as reducing geometry, light baking, occlusion culling, and use of LOD levels to switch alter detail levels dependant on distance were used to maximise performance.

A recording of the experience can be found in the repository.
